# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Overview: 
Developed a predictive model using machine learning to estimate house prices based on features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and construction details. This project helps in making informed decisions in the real estate industry by leveraging data-driven insights.

# Key Contributions:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data, handling missing values and categorical encoding using OneHotEncoder.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data relationships with Seaborn heatmaps and bar plots to identify key patterns.

Model Implementation: Trained and evaluated regression models:

Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Best Performance: MAPE = 0.18)

Random Forest Regressor

Linear Regression

Model Optimization: Improved accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.

# Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (SVM, Random Forest, Linear Regression)

# Impact:

Provided insights into market trends and pricing strategies for better decision-making.

Improved prediction accuracy by evaluating multiple models and optimizing them.

Demonstrated ability to apply ML techniques to solve real-world problems.
